# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (C & OpenGL) ðŸ“Š
Basic sorting algorithm visualizer I made as a first program to practise working with C ðŸ˜Ž. Graphics are created using OpenGL. When creating this, simplicity was my only real goal - I wanted to keep the code simple, easy to read, whilst obviously providing a decent level of functionality.

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

Once you have specified your desired array size and contents, the OpenGL display window should open.

From here the following controls should be available to you:

- **S**: Begins bubble sort.
- **Esc**: Exits out of the window.

<h3>Video Demonstration:</h3>

<h3>Known Bugs:</h3>

- If the program sorts for too long, it will freeze and only unfreeze once the sort has been completed.

<h3>TODO:</h3>

- Implement more sorting algorithmns.
- On screen instructions.
- Provide more customizability.
- Scale the bars' Y axis relative to the window's resolution in order to prevent the bars from clipping beyond the window's boundaries.
- (Maybe) Add sound.
